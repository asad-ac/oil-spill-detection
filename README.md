# Oil Spill Detection

Trained a <strong> ResNet-18 convolutional neural network (CNN) </strong> to detect marine oil spills, implementing data augmentation techniques with TensorFlow.
## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Oil spills have continued to cause severe and lasting damage to the environment. For reference, in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (the largest oil spill in history) **4.9 million barrels** (210 million gallons) of oil were released in the Gulf of Mexico.

This disaster alone is estimated to have killed:
- Up to **5 trillion** fish
- **84,000** birds
- At least **59,000** sea turtles <br>

We believe <strong> computer vision technology </strong> can help mitigate wildlife damage by identifying oil spills in water body images, while also supporting tourism, shipping, and the fishing industry.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Trained a ResNet-18 CNN using transfer learning on a **300-image marine oil spill dataset**. 
2. Enhanced dataset diversity by applying image augmentation techniques (flips, color adjustments, resizing) <br> to generate varied training samples from existing         images.
3. Achieved ~**86% validation accuracy** correctly classifying most oil spill and non-oil spill images.

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

To accomplish this, we utilized the ResNet-18 model to classify images of water bodies with supervised learning. Techniques that were incorporated:

- **Transfer Learning**: Pretrained on ImageNet, replacing the final layer for binary classification.
- **Image Normalization**: Improved feature extraction and pattern recognition.
- **Image Augmentation**: Increased dataset variety via flips, color changes, and resizing.
- **Freezing Layers**: Preserved pretrained knowledge while fine-tuning top layers.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Reduced overfitting.
- **Early Stopping**: Prevented unnecessary training once performance plateaued.
- **Differential Learning Rates**: Higher LR for new layers, lower for pretrained ones.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Adjusted LR during training for stability.
