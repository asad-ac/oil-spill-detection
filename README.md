# Oil Spill Detection

Trained a <strong> ResNet-18 convolutional neural network (CNN) </strong> to detect marine oil spills, implementing data augmentation techniques with TensorFlow.
## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Oil spills have continued to cause severe and lasting damage to the environment. For reference, in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (the largest oil spill in history) **4.9 million barrels** (210 million gallons) of oil were released in the Gulf of Mexico.

This disaster alone is estimated to have killed:
- Up to **5 trillion** fish
- **84,000** birds
- At least **59,000** sea turtles <br>
_(Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)_

We believe <strong> computer vision technology </strong> can help mitigate wildlife damage by identifying oil spills in water body images, while also supporting tourism, shipping, and the fishing industry.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Trained a ResNet-18 CNN using transfer learning on a **300-image marine oil spill dataset**. 
2. Enhanced dataset diversity by applying image augmentation techniques (flips, color adjustments, resizing) to generate varied training samples from existing images.
3. Achieved ~**86% validation accuracy**, correctly classifying most oil spill and non-oil spill images.

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

To accomplish this, we utilized the ResNet-18 model to classify images of water bodies with supervised learning. 

Techniques that were incorporated:

- **Transfer Learning**: Pretrained on ImageNet, replacing the final layer for binary classification.
  
- **Image Normalization**: Scaled RGB values between 0 and 1, then applied ImageNet mean and standard deviation for each channel to match ResNet-18’s pretrained input distribution.
  
- **Image Augmentation**: Increased dataset variety via flips, color changes, and resizing.
  
- **Freezing Layers**: Preserved pretrained knowledge while fine-tuning top layers and saving memory.
  
- **Dropout Regularization**: Prevent overfitting.
  
- **Early Stopping**: Prevented unnecessary training once performance plateaued. Specifically, if it didn't improve for 7 epochs.
  
- **Differential Learning Rates**: Higher LR for new layers, lower for pretrained ones.
  
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Adjusted LR during training for stability (if no improvement in 3 epochs cut learning rate in half).

## How to Run the Streamlit App <!--- new section -->

To interact with the oil spill detection model via the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.7 or higher** (if not installed):  
   Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set up and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   pip install streamlit torch torchvision pandas numpy matplotlib
   
3. **Run Streamlit App:**
   streamlit run oilspill_app.py

   App will automatically open, but can access http://localhost:8501

## Limitations & Future Work
- **Dataset Size & Diversity**: Limited image diversity (mostly ocean scenes) could bias predictions.
- **Class Imbalance**: Some oil spill images contain text overlays, which may influence results.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Expand dataset with varied water body types and conditions.
  - Revisit ResNet-50 to improve accuracy.
  - Deploy as a web app for real-time oil spill detection.
